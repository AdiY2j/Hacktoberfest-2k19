### Things to be noted
---

* This is an example of recycler view. It can be modified as per the choice of the developer.
* This is only one such application of recycler view but the basic functions remain the same and hence the need of publishing this template.
* The package name and the other code are left to the developers to tweak as per their use case and this is only one such basic use case.
* In the kotlin code, I have removed the search query from the recycler view to reduce complexity since Kotlin isn't clearly known to many and it is better to make the code as simple as possible.
* [x] Java implementation
* [x] Kotlin implementation
